# Badge

<p class="description">Badge generates a small badge to the top-right of its child(ren).</p>

{{"component": "modules/components/ComponentLinkHeader.js"}}

## Basic badge

Examples of badges containing text, using primary and secondary colors. The badge is applied to its children.

{{"demo": "pages/components/badges/SimpleBadge.js"}}

## Color

Use `color` prop to apply theme palette to component.

{{"demo": "pages/components/badges/ColorBadge.js"}}

## Customization

Here is an example of customizing the component.
You can learn more about this in the [overrides documentation page](/customization/how-to-customize/).

{{"demo": "pages/components/badges/CustomizedBadges.js"}}

## Badge visibility

The visibility of badges can be controlled using the `invisible` prop.

{{"demo": "pages/components/badges/BadgeVisibility.js"}}

The badge auto hides with badgeContent is zero. You can override this with the `showZero` prop.

{{"demo": "pages/components/badges/ShowZeroBadge.js"}}

## Maximum value

You can use the `max` prop to cap the value of the badge content.

{{"demo": "pages/components/badges/BadgeMax.js"}}

## Dot badge

The `dot` prop changes a badge into a small dot. This can be used as a notification that something has changed without giving a count.

{{"demo": "pages/components/badges/DotBadge.js"}}

## Badge overlap

You can use the `overlap` prop to place the badge relative to the corner of the wrapped element.

{{"demo": "pages/components/badges/BadgeOverlap.js"}}

## Badge alignment

You can use the `anchorOrigin` prop to move the badge to any corner of the wrapped element.

{{"demo": "pages/components/badges/BadgeAlignment.js", "hideToolbar": true}}

## Unstyled

The badge also comes with an unstyled version.
It's ideal for doing heavy customizations and minimizing bundle size.

```js
import BadgeUnstyled from '@mui/core/BadgeUnstyled';
```

{{"demo": "pages/components/badges/UnstyledBadge.js"}}

## Accessibility

You can't rely on the content of the badge to be announced correctly.
You should provide a full description, for instance, with `aria-label`:

{{"demo": "pages/components/badges/AccessibleBadges.js"}}
