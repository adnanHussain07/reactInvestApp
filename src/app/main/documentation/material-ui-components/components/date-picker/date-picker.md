# Date Picker

<p class="description">Date pickers let the user select a date.</p>

Date pickers let the user select a date. Date pickers are displayed with:

- Dialogs on mobile
- Text field dropdowns on desktop

{{"component": "modules/components/ComponentLinkHeader.js"}}

## Requirements

This component relies on the date management library of your choice. It supports [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/), [luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/), [dayjs](https://github.com/iamkun/dayjs), [moment](https://momentjs.com/) and any other library via a public `dateAdapter` interface.

Please install any of these libraries and set up the right date engine by wrapping your root (or the highest level you wish the pickers to be available) with `LocalizationProvider`:

```jsx
// or @mui/lab/Adapter{Dayjs,Luxon,Moment} or any valid date-io adapter
import AdapterDateFns from '@mui/lab/AdapterDateFns';
import LocalizationProvider from '@mui/lab/LocalizationProvider';

function App() {
  return (
    <LocalizationProvider dateAdapter={AdapterDateFns}>...</LocalizationProvider>
  );
}
```

## Basic usage

The date picker is rendered as a modal dialog on mobile, and a textbox with a popup on desktop.

{{"demo": "pages/components/date-picker/BasicDatePicker.js"}}

## Static mode

It's possible to render any date picker without the modal/popover and text field. This can be helpful when building custom popover/modal containers.

{{"demo": "pages/components/date-picker/StaticDatePickerDemo.js", "bg": true}}

## Responsiveness

The date picker component is designed and optimized for the device it runs on.

- The `MobileDatePicker` component works best for touch devices and small screens.
- The `DesktopDatePicker` component works best for mouse devices and large screens.

By default, the `DatePicker` component renders the desktop version if the media query [`@media (pointer: fine)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/pointer) matches.
This can be customized with the `desktopModeMediaQuery` prop.

{{"demo": "pages/components/date-picker/ResponsiveDatePickers.js"}}

## Form props

The date picker component can be disabled or read-only.

{{"demo": "pages/components/date-picker/FormPropsDatePickers.js"}}

## Localization

Use `LocalizationProvider` to change the date-engine locale that is used to render the date picker. Here is an example of changing the locale for the `date-fns` adapter:

{{"demo": "pages/components/date-picker/LocalizedDatePicker.js"}}

## Jalali calendar system

Install `date-fns-jalali` and use `@date-io/date-fns-jalali` adapter to support [Jalali calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalali_calendar).

{{"demo": "pages/components/date-picker/JalaliDatePicker.js"}}

## Views playground

It's possible to combine `year`, `month`, and `date` selection views. Views will appear in the order they're included in the `views` array.

{{"demo": "pages/components/date-picker/ViewsDatePicker.js"}}

## Landscape orientation

For ease of use, the date picker will automatically change the layout between portrait and landscape by subscription to the `window.orientation` change. You can force a specific layout using the `orientation` prop.

{{"demo": "pages/components/date-picker/StaticDatePickerLandscape.js", "bg": true}}

## Sub-components

Some lower-level sub-components (`CalendarPicker`, `MonthPicker`, and `YearPicker`) are also exported. These are rendered without a wrapper or outer logic (masked input, date values parsing and validation, etc.).

{{"demo": "pages/components/date-picker/SubComponentsPickers.js"}}

## Custom input component

You can customize the rendering of the input with the `renderInput` prop. Make sure to spread `ref` and `inputProps` correctly to the custom input component.

{{"demo": "pages/components/date-picker/CustomInput.js"}}

## Customized day rendering

The displayed days are customizable with the `renderDay` function prop.
You can take advantage of the [PickersDay](/api/pickers-day/) component.

{{"demo": "pages/components/date-picker/CustomDay.js"}}

## Dynamic data

Sometimes it may be necessary to display additional info right in the calendar. Here's an example of prefetching and displaying server-side data using the `onMonthChange`, `loading`, and `renderDay` props.

{{"demo": "pages/components/date-picker/ServerRequestDatePicker.js"}}

## Helper text

You can show a helper text with the date format accepted.

{{"demo": "pages/components/date-picker/HelperText.js"}}
