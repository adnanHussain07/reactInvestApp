# Date Time Picker

<p class="description">Combined date & time picker.</p>

This component combines the date & time pickers. It allows the user to select both date and time with the same control.

Note that this component is the [DatePicker](/components/date-picker/) and [TimePicker](/components/time-picker/)
component combined, so any of these components' props can be passed to the DateTimePicker.

{{"component": "modules/components/ComponentLinkHeader.js"}}

## Requirements

This component relies on the date management library of your choice. It supports [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/), [luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/), [dayjs](https://github.com/iamkun/dayjs), [moment](https://momentjs.com/) and any other library via a public `dateAdapter` interface.

Please install any of these libraries and set up the right date engine by wrapping your root (or the highest level you wish the pickers to be available) with `LocalizationProvider`:

```jsx
// or @mui/lab/Adapter{Dayjs,Luxon,Moment} or any valid date-io adapter
import AdapterDateFns from '@mui/lab/AdapterDateFns';
import LocalizationProvider from '@mui/lab/LocalizationProvider';

function App() {
  return (
    <LocalizationProvider dateAdapter={AdapterDateFns}>...</LocalizationProvider>
  );
}
```

## Basic usage

Allows choosing date then time. There are 4 steps available (year, date, hour and minute), so tabs are required to visually distinguish date/time steps.

## Responsiveness

The `DateTimePicker` component is designed and optimized for the device it runs on.

- The `MobileDateTimePicker` component works best for touch devices and small screens.
- The `DesktopDateTimePicker` component works best for mouse devices and large screens.

By default, the `DateTimePicker` component renders the desktop version if the media query [`@media (pointer: fine)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/pointer) matches.
This can be customized with the `desktopModeMediaQuery` prop.

## Form props

The date time picker component can be disabled or read-only.

## Date and time validation

It is possible to restrict date and time selection in two ways:

- by using `minDateTime`/`maxDateTime` its possible to restrict time selection to before or after a particular moment in time
- using `minTime`/`maxTime`, you can disable selecting times before or after a certain time each day respectively

## Static mode

It's possible to render any date & time picker inline. This will enable building custom popover/modal containers.

## Customization

Here are some examples of heavily customized date & time pickers:
