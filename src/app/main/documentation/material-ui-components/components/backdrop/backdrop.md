# Backdrop

<p class="description">The backdrop component is used to provide emphasis on a particular element or parts of it.</p>

The backdrop signals to the user of a state change within the application and can be used for creating loaders, dialogs, and more.
In its simplest form, the backdrop component will add a dimmed layer over your application.

{{"component": "modules/components/ComponentLinkHeader.js"}}

## Example

{{"demo": "pages/components/backdrop/SimpleBackdrop.js"}}

## Unstyled

The backdrop also comes with the unstyled package.
It's ideal for doing heavy customizations and minimizing bundle size.

```js
import Backdrop from '@mui/core/Backdrop';
```
